# Galactic Chess: The Ultimate Space Battle

## Introduction
Galactic Chess is a variant of the classic chess game, set in a space-themed universe where players control a fleet of starships. The aim of the game is to capture the opponent's `Star Commander`, while protecting one's own. 

## Inspiration

Galactic Chess was inspired by a fascinating game of chess played by the AI ChatGPT against Stockfish, as presented by Gotham Chess in this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSCNW1OCk_M&ab_channel=GothamChess). The game was filled with controversial moves and ultimately ended with ChatGPT emerging victorious against Stockfish.

This video sparked the imagination and led to the creation of Galactic Chess, a game that incorporates innovative new rules and abilities that allow players to experience chess in a whole new way.

## Pieces and Movement
The pieces in Galactic Chess have been renamed to fit the theme: 
- Star Commander (King)
- Cruiser (Knight)
- Solar Scouter (Bishop)
- Destroyer (Rook)
- Privateer (Pawn)
- Warlord (Queen)

Each piece has its own unique movements, following the same rules as classical chess.

## Special Rules
In addition to the standard rules of chess, Galactic Chess includes several special rules to enhance gameplay. 

### Wormhole
`Wormhole` is an unconventional movement rule that allows a player to move their piece to any vulnerable square on the board. `Star Commander` can't use a Wormhole.

### Gravity Control
`Gravity Control` is the ability for a player to control an opponent's piece by capturing it. A piece that is under Gravity Control can be used to capture other pieces, but only one piece can be under control at a time. Using Gravity Control results in a turn skip, but the opponent cannot recapture the piece this turn or it will result in an `Imperial Offering`. 

### WarpGate
A `WarpGate` is the ability to summon a piece to any vulnerable square on the board. A player can summon a maximum of three extra pawns, with restrictions concerning special pieces yet to be defined.

### Imperial Offering
A `Imperial Offering` is the act of capturing one's own piece to gain positional advantage for the entire empire. Any special pieces can't move during the next turn.

## Revised Names for Existing Chess Moves
The traditional chess moves have been given a new twist with the Galactic Fleet theme, with new names that reflect the militaristic and space-themed nature of the game. Here's a rundown of the revised names:

- Castling: `Hyperjump`
- En Passant: `Galactic Redeployment`

## Check and Checkmate
- `Starship in Peril` refers to a situation where the Star Commander is under direct attack by an opponent's piece. 
- `Starship Forced to Surrender` refers to a situation where the Star Commander is unable to escape attack and has been captured by the opponent. 
- `Galaxy Blockade` refers to a situation where a player cannot make a legal move.

## Conclusion
Galactic Chess is a fun and challenging game that combines classic chess with exciting new elements. May the best fleet emerge victorious!
